I wanted to create a nice personal page for my articles and ramblings.

Previously i looked into [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and liked its simplicity and forwardness.\\
I started there, but find it to be too white for my taste...

So i added [{ Personal }](https://panossakkos.github.io/personal-jekyll-theme) as custom theme.\\
And a few tweaks later i had my empty site. Looking good and all !!!

Next question was how to deploy it, i have my domain in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)\\
and i always keep my code in some form of Git. That led me to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).\\
And a few tweaks later i had my site deployed and working fine.

Here i am adding my first post, hopefully the first of many to come...
